I believe it's important, as an aspiring scientist and also as someone who believes in the importance of civic engagement, to ensure that my field of study is respected and properly interpreted by governments, universities, and any other decision-making institutions that have influence over our day-to-day lives. The decisions these groups make should be informed by accurate climate science, and my advocacy is motivated by ensuring that happens.

The Climate Reality Project is a non-partisan non-profit devoted to "empowering everyday people to become activists, equipped with the tools, training, and network to fight for solutions and drive change planet-wide." They accomplish this through providing leadership trainings (I attended a training in August 2019) and through supporting various activist chapters.

My student chapter (CRCC at NC State) focuses on campaigning for achievable, scientifically informed solutions and policies our university can adopt in order to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. In the past, we've campaigned for our university to generate electricity through renewables and for adopting builiding codes that emphasize energy efficiency. Most recently, our efforts have been focused on a divestment campaign. NC State has at least $43 million of its $1 billion endowment invested in fossil fuel commodities, and an unknown amount invested in fossi fuel-associated companies. We believe the university is able to re-invest these assets in an environemtally- and socially-responsible
