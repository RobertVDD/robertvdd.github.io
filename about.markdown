<p>I am currently a 4th year undergraduate student at NC State University, double-majoring in Applied Mathematics and Meteorology.
This website showcases a few different research projects I've been a part of over my undergraduate career. In the future, I may also add other various side projects or new research as I continue my education.</p>
